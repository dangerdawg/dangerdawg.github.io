  <p>E, everyone</p>
    <p>g, most people. may contain traces of adult content.</p>
      <p>pg, decide if you want to read or not. may have some ungood things.</p>
        <p>13, scary, probably want to be around 13 to read the whole book</p>
          <p>m, pretty scary, probably want parents to decide if you can read it. may have adult themes</p>
            <p>r, parents should definetly decide if you can read it. has adult themes and/or extreme violence</p>
              <p> r+, very violent/thematic/gory/sad. you should probably be of considerable age to read books with this rating</p>
                <p> rr-, exremely thematic and violent and other stuff like that. rr, but a bit less (*_*)</P>
                  <p>rr, I don't think any books have this rating, but if they do, it is restricted for adult reading.</p>

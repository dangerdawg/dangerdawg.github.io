    <br>
    <br>
enchanta castle was the biggest minecraft build for a long time. it was built <br>
for a world called <strong><em>humongous.</em></strong> enchanta castle was made for the king<br>
of enchanta. the castle was around 50 blocks high, and 100 wide. it set many records.<br>
the first floor is a redstone hidden door. it opens up to a really cool room.<br>
the room behind the door includes an ender chest, a shulker box, and a bed. the<br>
lighting is a jack-o-lantern. you can go down a latter in front of the door to see<br>
the redstone that makes the door work. there's a secret passage-way that leads to the <br>
dungeons.<br>

 these are some veiws of enchanta castle. the country that it is in is called<br>
 enchanta and thats why it is called enchanta castle. as you can tell, <em>humongous</em><br>
 is a creative world.<br>
 the second floor of enchanta castle is the grand hall. it is ten blocks high.<br>
 it has a  throne at one end of  it and hidden treasure chests by it.  it has netherack<br>
 torches for lighting, and giant pillars. it is very cool.<br>
 <img src="/Screen%20Shot%202020-05-11%20at%202.15.26%20PM.png" width="500px" alt="grand hall"><br>
 the third floor of enchanta castle is the defense floor. it has zombie and skeleton<br>
 spawners for combat training.
 <br>
 <img src="/Screen%20Shot%202020-05-11%20at%202.15.46%20PM.png" width="500px" alt="defense floor"><br>
  it also has the doors  to the walls of enchanta.<br>
 the walls have a checkerboard of purple and blue carpet on them. the lighting for<br>
 the walls is glowstone.<br></p>

 <div id="s2"><strong><em>humongous story II</em></strong></div>
          <strong>the mansion</strong><br>
one of the biggest builds in humongous was the mansion. it is not as big as enchanta<br>
castle, but it still is huge. it's made primarily of quartz and pur pur(the national<br>
block of enchanta)  it also includes daimond, gold, and end rods. there is a four-poster<br>
bed on the second floor and cakes on the first. the main lighting for the first floor<br>
is end rod chandeliers.<br>

there is also lava lighting for both floors. I made this mansion for edialophulus<br>

<p>
  we will survive was one of the best survival worlds <strong>ever.</strong> we had a big castle called<br>
  five-level fortress in a base called taiga tower. it had a farm, and a horse with<br>
  daimond horse armor. the horse was named spruce with a nametag that we got from a dungeon.<br>
  we also accidentally caused a raid on a taiga village and got killed four times in a row<br>
  by a vindicator. it was not fun. but eventually, the raid stopped. the village had<br>
  no iron golem.
</p>
<h5>life in taiga tower</h5>
<p> life in taiga  tower is not too difficult. we have lots of good stuff in taiga tower. like a<br>
room made entirely out of obsidian. with an enchantment table, grindstone, and cauldron.<br>
the worst place in taiga tower is the nether. we have a nice place 'n' all, but zombie pigmen<br>
have put it under seige. we do have a bunch of glowstone though. we've started to build a<br>
nether brick part of five-level fortress, but our supplie of netherack to smelt was cut short when<br>
the zombie pigmen laid seige on our nether house.<br>
</p>
<p> we used to have like, five cats in taiga tower, but then we accidentally killed one, another<br>
  stepped into a netherack fire  torch, another tried to swim in lava, and we were left with only<br>
  snowy, who decided to take a trip to the nether with us. thankfully, she survived, and we got<br>
  her back to the overworld, where we sat her.
</p>
<p>most of our tools in <em>we will survive<em> are enchanted, because we got a bunch of lapis lazuli<br>
from our mine. we once had an enchanted fishing rod called <span class="en">fishy rod</span>, it was very sad<br>
when it broke. we also had an enchanted daimond pickaxe called <span class="en">ultra pick</span>. it was very fast<br>
at mining. we also had an enchanted golden pickaxe called <span class="en">ultre.</span> it was pretty fast but<br>
couldn't mine ores.
</p>

<div class="we-will-srv-again" id="we-will-indeed-survive">
  <h5><strong><em>we will survive again<em><strong></h5>
<p>we will survive again was a survival world we created not too long ago, in which we have an enchanted<br>
daimond pickaxe called <span class="en">ultra pick II</span>. we also have a giant under ground fortress<br>
that starts in a ravine with a chicken coop on one of the edges. there is a big giant man made river running<br>
through the ravine, and a redstone inescapable piston trap outside of the door. we have three beds in the<br>
first room you see when you go in, the middle one is yellow, and the outsides are blue. then, you open a<br>
door on the right blue bed, and then go through a short hallway to our mine storage room, and beyond that,<br>
with no door separating it from the storage room, is the mineshaft.</p>
<h5>thirty minute daimonds</h5>
<p>we were in our mine, still making the descending staircase, around level fourteen, when we broke one block,<br>
and found the ultimate prize behind it. <span class="en">daimonds!</span> and, it was the maximum amount<br>
that you could find in a single vein. <em>eight!</em> and, we were only in the first half hour of our world!<br>
after we had mined all of the daimonds, we quickly went back up our staircase, to our crafting area, and crafted<br>
a daimond pickaxe. after that, we started a branch mine at the level we had found the daimonds at, which was<br>
two blocks above the lava level. we found a few more daimonds, and started making an emergency bunker, which was an<br>
under ground room made entirely out of cobblestone. we found eight more daimonds in the process, making a new record<br>
for most daimonds found. <em>22!</em> after finding more of the daimonds, we made some more branch mines, and ended<br>
up making a maze of underground tunnels. we found tons and tons of obsidian, and made a nether portal. as soon as we<br>
got to the nether, we made a portal protecter in about thirty seconds, and went back to the overworld. we made a <br>
chicken farm at the entrance to the ravine, and put hoppers in each corner. now, every time a chicken lays an egg,<br>
the hoppers will collect it.</p>

<p class="en">creativity is probably one of the most important things in minecraft.</p>
<p class="text"> it helps you come up with something to build,  it can help you build<br>
  that thing, it can help you do almost <em>anything</em>.<br>

  <div class="en" id="creative2"><p> this section will be about all the things you can do in creative mode.<br>
    one advantage you have in creative mode is: <strong><em>you can fly!!!!!!!!!</em></strong><br>
    another advantage, YOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE BLOCK IN MINECRAFT!<br>
    (except for the dragon egg, of course you can only get <em>that</em> if you go to the<br>
    end and kill the ender dragon and push it off it's pedestal with a piston)<br>
    but anyway, lets get to the topic of building!</p>
<p> these are some of our best creative builds.

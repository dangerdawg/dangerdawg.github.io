The village<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Chapter 1<br><br>
<br><br>
My name is Corin shepherd. I am not a shepherd, it’s just my last name. I do like sheep though, <br><br>
and I do use their wool in my mother’s loom. I am eleven years old, I am an only child, and I live in <br><br>
the village of wing, which is run by the all powerful Braiden The Big. I actually don’t like him that much, <br><br>
but if I said that, I would be burned at the stake for treason. In this part of the country moonland, <br><br>
there is a hunt for these creatures called arrows. They’re basically reverse ocelots. Black with yellow spots. <br><br>
They also have yellow wings with black spots, and can breathe blue fire. There is also this super rare sub-species <br><br>
called spearhead, and they’re all black and much bigger. They’re so big that you could ride one if you wanted to. <br><br>
But most people don’t want to, because killing one is a huge honor. The spearheads are always the ones that <br><br>
lead arrow colonies, and they rarely have babies. sometimes, an arrow colony will carry out an attack on a village<br><br>
 that hunts them, and usually, one of the sides is completely wiped out. It’s usually the village though. Some people<br><br>
  in our village are actually opposed to the arrow hunt, but they don’t say it unless it’s to one of their close friends<br><br>
   that they know can keep a secret.<br><br>
	it was a Wednesday morning, and I was in the market, talking to my friends, James, Conor, Erin, Avery, and bear. <br><br>
  I was telling them about how I had made a blanket with my mother’s loom. I had showed them the blanket, which was white <br><br>
  with delicately embroidered pink and blue sheep, and they said it was cool. I went to put the blanket back in my house, <br><br>
  and then went back.<br><br>
	I was in my mother’s house when it happened. The arrow horn sounded. That meant there was an arrow in town. <br><br>
  I went out of the house to the town square, and saw it. And then I saw Braiden The Big chasing it. He was using<br><br>
   his rapid fire crossbow technique to try to kill it, but it didn’t look like he was having any luck so far. His <br><br>
   crossbow arrows always landed a few feet behind it.<br><br>
“get back here” he said in a heavy Irish accent. He finally landed an arrow on it’s tail, which slowed it down a little bit.<br><br>
 Braiden finally killed the arrow by shooting it in the neck.<br><br>
“that was so cool” I said, “I want to kill and arrow one day”<br><br>
My mother came out and said, “I bet you will someday”<br><br>
“thanks” I said.<br><br>
“I really think you will” said my mother, “it would be really good for us”<br><br>
“good job” I said, “now you’ve motivated me more to kill one”<br><br>
“good” said my mother, “speaking of arrows, you should go to the woods some time to kill one”<br><br>
she’s been trying to get me to go in the woods for ages.<br><br>
“I don’t like to go into the woods unless I have to” I said.<br><br>
“don’t you want to kill an arrow?” Said my mother.<br><br>
“yeah” I said.<br><br>
“so do you have to?” Asked my mother.<br><br>
“no” I said.<br><br>
“yes” said my mother.<br><br>
“what” I said.<br><br>
“you have to” said my mother.<br><br>
“fine” I said.<br><br>
“that’s a good boy” said my mother.<br><br>
“if you say so” I said.<br><br>
“well I do” she said in a very matter of factly tone.<br><br>
I guess she did say so, because after I had eaten lunch, I had gotten most of my stuff that I needed for the woods.<br><br>
 I got my bow, my dagger, my sheath of arrows, and a smaller knife.<br><br>
“I’ll go” I said, holding my bow in my hand, and everything else in my belt.<br><br>
 My mother made me get a bunch of food to bring with me into the forest. I took some bread and water with me,<br><br>
  but she also made me bring some beef.<br><br>
“now” said my mother, “bring home an arrow.”<br><br>
“don’t worry” I said, “I will”<br><br>
	I opened the door of our house and walked out. then, I walked down the street to a hole in the village wall.<br><br>
   The wall was about fifty feet tall, but I had found a hole in it. It was small, but I could fit through. <br><br>
   I had found it when I was going for a walk when I had recovered from fever. I was moving my hand along the wall,<br><br>
    and it fell through the cloth that covered the wall and through the hole. Once I had found the hole, I had gone to the woods,<br><br>
     but the woods were so full weird creatures that I just ran back home. After seeing even only a few of the creatures,<br><br>
      I decided I never wanted to go back to the forest ever in my whole entire life.<br><br>
	that day, I was almost at the hole, when I saw a sword on the ground.I wondered why there would be a sword there, <br><br>
  just lying on the ground, but then I realized that it was right next to the blacksmith storage warehouse.<br><br>
“must have fallen out of one of the crates” I said, as I picked it up, for extra protection. I climbed through the hole, <br><br>
and into the forest. I looked around and didn’t immediately see any of the crazy creatures I had before. One that I had seen before<br><br>
 that made a big impression on me was the neon wolf. It was basically a neon wolf that could change color. When I had seen the neon wolf,<br><br>
  at first, I was amazed. That was until it tried to eat me. luckily, a falling tree save me from it.<br><br>
	Another creature that made a big impression was the ranger. It was basically a big white rat the size of a cat, that likes to eat tree bark.<br><br>
   And human beings apparently, because when I went in the forest before, it seemed intent on making my nose a snack.<br><br>
	There were all kinds of other creatures in the forest, but I didn’t pay much attention to any of them.<br><br>
	I kept walking through the forest, and every step I took brought me farther into the creepiness. I actually started to get used to it, <br><br>
  until I was attacked by a ranger. It jumped up, and tried to bite me in the face. I quickly used the sword from the warehouse to block it and <br><br>
  cut it across the snout. I may have cut it pretty bad in the face, but it still wanted to kill me. I ended up stabbing it in the neck<br><br>
   to get rid of it, and moved on. Once I had gotten pretty big distance into the forest, I came across some sort of vine that I had never<br><br>
    seen before, and it was a good thing I hadn’t, because the times I’d entered the forest before, I had no weapons, and you need weapons to fight them.<br><br>
     I actually had sort of a duel with the vines, them attempting to strangle me, me trying to cut it. <br><br>
     I cut one of the many vines, but then another one grabbed my foot. I used my dagger to cut the one on my foot, <br><br>
     but not before another grabbed hold of my arm. I kept fighting for a while, because it was really hard. <br><br>
     I actually beat all the vines, by using my sword in my right hand, and dagger in my left. I had been going for a long time, <br><br>
     and then it started to get dark, so I went back to wing.<br><br>
	when I got back, my mother asked me if I had found any arrows, and I said no. she seemed disappointed, which did not surprise me.<br><br>
	the next day, when I got out of bed, I told my mother that I was going out into the forest. I ran into a few rangers, <br><br>
  but besides that, I ran into nothing. I also saw a few downed trees, but nothing else.<br><br>
	then, I saw a little something that really grabbed my attention. It was an arrow. I quickly got my bow<br><br>
   out and shot. No hit. Another shot. No hit. Another shot. A hit! I had hit it in the tail, and pinned it to a tree.<br><br>
    I got out my dagger and approached it carefully. I got closer, and closer, and closer, and closer.<br><br>
“I can’t kill you” I said in a worried tone.<br><br>
It meowed it’s approval at my decision.<br><br>
“I guess you like my decision.” I said.<br><br>
again, it meowed it’s approval. I laughed, and removed the arrow from it’s tail, and then I noticed something<br><br>
 I hadn’t before. it was completely black, and small, which meant I had found a baby spearhead. I let out a gasp.<br><br>
  I had found the rarest creature in the world.<br><br>
“your a spearhead” I said, astonished.<br><br>
This time, it roared, and it’s mother and father approached. They were big enough even Braiden the big could ride one of them.<br><br>
“oh wow” I said.<br><br>
The parents came over to me, and I swore to god that I would protect their baby, whatever it took.<br><br>

Chapter 2
<br><br>
I was so astonished by the fact that I had found the rarest creature on earth, and I wanted to savor <br><br>
the moment so much, that I told them I would steal medical supplies from wing to bring to them. <br><br>
I had a whole plan laid out. And since kids weren’t aloud to buy medical supplies, and my mother didn’t <br><br>
know I was planning to help an arrow instead of kill one, I decided I would just steal it. I swore I would<br><br>
 not let them down, and I didn’t want to, since I would make history if I managed to actually live with them,<br><br>
  although the only history I would make would be my history books. If I even decided to right it in.<br><br>
	I started making a little camp before I left, and it was pretty good. It was a tent made out of sticks,<br><br>
   and if I could manage to steal some cloth from the village, I could add that on the outside. <br><br>
   I had put together a plan of how I could steal medical supplies from the doctor. I would sneak under the<br><br>
    cloth that made up the tent, and once inside, I would get whatever I could without being seen. I would try<br><br>
     to get ointment and bandages, but if I couldn’t, I could always rip some cloth out of part of the wall that<br><br>
      didn’t have a hole in it. Ointment would be my top priority, since the baby spearhead needed something to help<br><br>
       the big hole going all the way through his tail.<br><br>
	I was getting ready to go, and I left everything except for my dagger at the camp I made. I bid them goodbye, and went back<br><br>
   towards the wall, determined not to run into any strange creatures this time. I really got lucky walking through the forest,<br><br>
    because I didn’t run into any of the strange creatures. I carefully went through the hole, and made sure to stay hidden while I<br><br>
     walked to the doctor.<br><br>
	when I got to the doctors tent, I crawled under the flap, and when I was inside, I immediately saw the<br><br>
   container of ointment I was looking for. I quickly grabbed it while the doctor was busy, and stuffed it in my pocket.<br><br>
    next, I was looking around for the bandages, and I found it. It was right beside the doctor, who was working with a patient.<br><br>
     I crawled close to the bandages, and quickly grabbed them, and made a break for it out the flap. The doctor heard the noise,<br><br>
      and looked where the bandages used to be, and saw that it was gone.<br><br>
“somebody took the bandages that I was using on a patient” she yelled very angrily.<br><br>
Good thing I had escaped quickly, because any later, and I would have been seen, and reported. I quickly ran to the hole,<br><br>
 not caring if I was seen or not, and when I reached it, I quickly jumped through, and ran through the forest, to the spearheads.<br><br>
  I might have run into some of the forest creatures on my way there, but if I did, I would have been going so fast, they wouldn’t have<br><br>
   been able to catch me.<br><br>
	when I reached them, they looked expectantly up at me, and I pulled out the medical supplies. They seemed confused, and cocked their heads.<br><br>

   I took the wooden cap off the wooden container of ointment, dipped my finger in, and rubbed it on the baby spearheads injured tail.<br><br>
“see” I said.<br><br>
I don’t think they understood, because they just cocked their heads again. I took out the roll of bandages, and wrapped it around the young spearheads tail,<br><br>
 until I thought it was enough, and put everything back in my pockets. The young spearhead started jumping around in circles.<br><br>
  It looked like he was doing that because he was happy, but who knows, they’re animals that we haven’t researched, only killed. I started<br><br>
   trying to think of good names for the young arrow, but none came, and then suddenly, it came; thunder. It was a good name, and it went<br><br>
    well with how he was completely black, the color of thunder clouds.<br><br>
“I’m gonna call you thunder” I said to the little spearhead. he started doing it’s jumpy thing again, so I guess he liked the name as<br><br>
 much as I did. I suddenly noticed that the sun was going down, so I told them I had to go, and went back to my house.<br><br>
	when I got back, I got the reaction I was definitely expecting.<br><br>
“no arrow?” Said my mother.<br><br>
“nope” I said.<br><br>
“well thats a shame” said my mother.<br><br>
“yeah” I said, as I put all my stuff away and went to my bedroom, where I started thinking about what I should do. I thought about running away,<br><br>
 but I didn’t think it was a good idea, since they’d just come after me, and I’d be dead in a minute if I was caught. plus, I could just go to the forest each day,<br><br>
  and have the excuse of trying to kill arrows. I decided that I would get the spearheads help to make a good camp in the woods, and then, once it was done,<br><br>
   I would ask my mother if I could stay a few nights in the woods, to have a better chance of catching one. then, I could stay there to think about a long term solution,<br><br>
    and get to stay with the spearheads full time. after coming up with the plan, I decided to get some sleep, since I had a big day ahead of me.<br><br>
	the next day, I told my mother I was going to the forest again, to catch an arrow, grabbed my supplies, and went to the forest. I had to fight off another one of those death vines,<br><br>
   but besides that, I had no problem getting to the spearheads. Once I was there, I told them I needed them to help me build a good house, so I could live there for<br><br>
    long periods of time. The spearheads agreed, and they led me to a river, not to far from the camp I had made.<br><br>
I thought, ‘a source of water, great’ I approved their decision of location, and marked out a space for the house with a stick. I suddenly noticed that young thunder<br><br>
 had grown a lot over night, and that now, a little kid could ride it if it wanted to. Thunder started ramming a tree, probably to try to get it to fall over, and I think that because it fell over.<br><br>
“nice job” I said. Thunder meowed, and then started biting through the log like a beaver.<br><br>
	By the time thunder was finished, I had a good eight boards, which one of thunder’s parents sanded with their paw, and then it was polished by the other parent breathing their blue<br><br>
   fire on it, which I guess can only burn things if the arrow it belongs to wants to. I asked thunder if we could get some help from otherarrows. To my surprise, he let out a very loud roar<br><br>
    that could probably be heard from wing, and then a bunch of arrows came out from no where, and stood at attention, in front of thunder.<br><br>
“wow” I said.<br><br>
Thunder meowed to me, and then instructed the arrows to help build. The building actually was building up pretty fast. In an hour, the first floor was done, including a bed,<br><br>
 with wall cloth for sheets. The bed was in the window room. then, at lunch time, thunder brought a freshly caught rabbit, and cooked it with his own fire, so that it would be safe <br><br>
 for me to eat. I sat at the dining room for humans, and ate while thunder and his parents ate in the animal dining room, which was across from the human room, but still on the same half.<br><br>
  On the other have was the window room. a room with a big window, bed, and a fireplace. After we finished lunch, we went back to work on the upstairs. We made all the animal bedrooms, which was two,<br><br>
   right above the dining rooms, and the upstairs window room. The sun was going down by the time we finished the second floor, so I bid them goodbye, and returned home.<br><br>
	when I got home, I was not surprised when my mother asked me why I didn’t have an arrow body.<br><br>
“I couldn’t find any” I lied.<br><br>
“better luck next time” she said.<br><br>
“I’ll need it” I said.<br><br>

Chapter 3<br><br>
<br><br>
When I woke up, I quickly got all of my stuff together, and woke up my mother. I told her I was going to the forest early, so I would have more time to catch the arrows. She agreed.<br><br>
 lazily, and so I got my gear together, and grabbed some honey that I could use to stick leaves and sticks to the house for camouflage. I went out the door and walked to the hole in the wall.<br><br>
  I encountered none of my forest enemies, only the friends, and told them my honey plan. We got to work on the roof before camouflage, and made it mostly flat, but a little bit slanted.<br><br>
   After the roof was built, we started the camouflaging. I have to admit, I would not have known there was a house there if it weren’t for the brown-ish sign we put on it so<br><br>
    we knew it was there. We sat inside for the rest of the day, marveling at the house we made.<br><br>
	at lunch time, I decided to go hunt by the river, to get food. When I went to hunt, I saw a few ducks, and easily killed them with my bow and arrow. But then I saw something<br><br>
   I thought would make a much better meal. A deer. I took out my bow, notched an arrow, and shot it. I killed it in one hit, then brought it back for lunch. I cut it up with my smaller knife,<br><br>
    and thunder cooked it. After lunch, we all went to the upstairs window room, and I sat in a chair, thinking about what I should do. I decided I would think tomorrow, <br><br>
    when I would actually be spending the night there.<br><br>
	the next day, I asked my mother if I could stay at my camp, and guess what, she said I could stay for two weeks! I got my stuff together and went to the camp. When I got there,<br><br>
   I told everybody the good news, and thunder did his happy circle jump thing again. I went inside, and started thinking about what I should do about the spearheads, and I thought about<br><br>
    telling other people about it, but I decided against it. I thought about running away, but I had no protection, and I would get executed for treason if the villagers saw the spearheads.<br><br>
	I eventually decided to go look beyond the river for anything useful, and told thunder to come with me. When we got to the river, I realized it was deeper then it looked. We ended up uprooting a <br><br>
  tree and made it fall across the river. When we had crossed, we were immediately attacked by neon wolves. One of the neon wolves lunged for me, but I easily deflected it with my dagger.<br><br>
   The wolf I had deflected recoiled and sprung for me again. That time, I wasn’t so lucky. It bit me in the leg, and I had to kill it to get it off. There were still three more<br><br>
    neon wolves after I had killed one, and thunder spat his blue fire at them.<br><br>
“nice” I said. He did his happy jumpy thing again.<br><br>
	I decided that we deserved a snack after that battle, and I figured a ranger would do good as a small one, so I got out my bow and started looking for one. Once I had shot<br><br>
   a good fat one, I told thunder to cook it.<br><br>
	after we had eaten the ranger, we kept on going in the woods, but not out of sight of the river. Then I saw it. A log cabin covered in leaves. A one room log cabin. fascinated,<br><br>
   I stepped closer and wondered who would live here. In the middle of that forest.<br><br>
	suddenly, a girl about a year younger than me stepped out with a spearhead about thunders age. She looked extremely surprised to see another human being near her cabin with a spearhead.<br><br>
“what are you doing here” I asked.<br><br>
“I could ask the same of you” she said.<br><br>
“I was exploring, and came across your house” I said.<br><br>
“really” she said, “what village are you from”<br><br>
“wing” I said.<br><br>
“so you probably know helping an arrow is punishable by death” she said.<br><br>
“I do” I said, “and by the way, what village are you from”<br><br>
“mesa” she said, “I ran away so I could live with cloudy”<br><br>
“who’s cloudy” I asked.<br><br>
“this guy” she said, pointing to her spearhead.<br><br>
“I have a cabin across the river” I said, “wanna see?”<br><br>
“I watched you build it” she said.<br><br>
“what’s your name?” I asked.<br><br>
“Aisling” she said, “what’s yours?”<br><br>
 “Corin” I answered.<br><br>
“Corin” said Aisling, “I like that name”<br><br>
“thanks” I said.<br><br>
“and by the way” said Aisling, “I do want to see your house”<br><br>
	I took her to the house, and she said she really liked it. I told her that I hadn’t run away from home, and that it would be super easy to bust me if I did,<br><br>
   but she told me to use my spearhead to assemble the arrows, and make a town in between our houses, and have an arrow military guard it. I said that her idea was a really good one,<br><br>
    and assembled the arrows. I knew we would need camouflage for the walls, so I stole some more honey from the village to stick leaves to the walls.<br><br>
	once I had gotten the honey for the walls, I worked with some of the arrows, putting together mini houses and seeing if they liked them. One that the arrows<br><br>
   really liked was a mini tent with leaves and honey on the outside. I started building some more of the tents while the arrows worked on the walls. Aisling helped some<br><br>
   <br><br> other arrows put together warehouses for supplies, and a medical section inside. I had made a good ten tents by lunch time.<br><br>
	for lunch, we had some of the ducks I caught, and some of the edible plants Aisling picked. After lunch, I went to the window room to relax. I. Started thinking<br><br>
   about how I should run away. I thought after going to the forest next time I went home would be good. I. Started thinking about if I should tell anybody,<br><br>
    but nobody came to mind. It would be a while until I ran away anyway. 	But then, I had to think about what I would do about Aisling. She was pretty, but I would<br><br>
     have to earn her trust before she would even except me as a friend. And I needed her as a friend. but, she was helping. So I guess that was a start.<br><br>
      then, I got a brilliant idea. I could ask for her help about how I should run away, and we could get closer then. I went go ask her if she could spare any<br><br>
       time from building the warehouse, and she said yes, and we went to the downstairs window room, and both sat on my bed.<br><br>
“so” She said, “you needed to talk to me”<br><br>
“yeah” I said, “I need help about planning my escape”<br><br>
“well” she said, “how do you usually get out” “I go through a hole in the village wall” I said.<br><br>
“well” she said, “that’s a start. All you need now is a way to get out without your parents noticing.”<br><br>
“that’ll be hard” I said.<br><br>
“why?” Said Aisling.<br><br>
“we have a loud door” I said.<br><br>
“oh” she said, “I know”<br><br>
“what” I said.<br><br>
“tell your parents you’re going to stay here some more, and then don’t go back” she said.<br><br>
“that’s actually a pretty good plan” I said.<br><br>
“I know, right” said Aisling.<br><br>
“right” I said.<br><br>
“I hope it goes well” said Aisling.<br><br>
“me too” I said.<br><br>
“just remember” said Aisling, “don’t tell anybody”<br><br>
“I won’t forget” I said.<br><br>
“good” said Aisling.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

chapter 4<br><br>
<br><br>
It was a few days since the talk about my escape, and I was actually a little bit more excited about it, because I knew that I would be<br><br>
 living with somebody smart, and I just fancied the thought of running away. We had actually setup the part of the wall closest to wing,<br><br>
  and we were starting bridges over the river for the wall so we wouldn’t have to dam the river. We were starting on the northern side, since the<br><br>
   closest other village besides wing was in that direction.<br><br>
	we were almost done building the bridge, when we heard thunder. Not my spearhead, but actual thunder. Which meant lightning. which meant rain. Which meant flood. We quickly went to the window room and watched as the first flood wave hit the bridge. It didn’t do much damage, but the second wave swept half the bridge away.
“I think were going to need to reinforce that more” I said.
“agreed” said Aisling.
	just then, a huge flood wave came down the river, uprooted two trees on each side of the river, and swept away the arrow tents closest to the river.And the arrows inside them. Aisling grabbed my hand just as another huge wave swept through the river. She rested her head on my shoulder and gripped my hand tighter. then, as lightning struck a nearby tree, she started started to cry. We both. Sat down on my bed, and she screamed as she watched a giant wave sweep everything twenty or less feet from the river away. That was most of the arrow tents, the warehouse, and many trees. It took a few hours for the storm to run it’s course, and the destruction was incredible. Everything within twenty feet of the river was completely destroyed, and all that was left was a bunch of mud, and some logs scattered around.
“I worked so long on that warehouse” said Aisling.
I was completely speechless at the level of destruction the storm caused. And then I was even more speechless, if that makes any sense, when the spearheads brought back all the debris, without moving, and placed everything back where it used to be.
“wow” I said.
“indeed” said Aisling.
“but we probably should destroy and rebuild the bridge, maybe use stone if we can get our hands on it.” I said.
“I bet the spearheads could do that” said Aisling.
“I bet so” I said.
Aisling was right. We asked the spearheads for stone, and they assembled the arrows, and the arrows went off some where, and then came back with a bunch of stone, which, with the spearheads help of course, we turned into a wall, and used stone pillars for supports.
	once we had finished that part of the wall, I went to work camouflaging it with leaves and honey, while Aisling worked on the other parts of the wall. When the sun started going down, we all went to our houses, had dinner, and slept.
	The next day, I finished camouflaging the rock, and started camouflage on the parts of the wall that Aisling and the others worked on. We got the wall done in a week, and then I started working on camouflage uniforms we could wear outside of our village. I sewed together clothes out of wall cloth, and honeyed leaves on to them. I decided to incorporate some metal I had stolen from the village in, so that they could work as armor. When I showed Aisling hers, she said she loved it, and that was good, because, for some strange reason, I got the feeling we would be needing it.Chapter 5

I asked Aisling if she thought it was a good idea to tell other people in wing about our little village, and she said’ “only people you trust” so I went to wing, and told my most trusted friends. James, Conor, Erin, Avery, and bear. My most trusted friends. When I showed them the village, they were obviously impressed. I told them they could tell no one at all about this, because it was against the law. Our law anyway. then, when they saw we were living with arrows, they understood why they couldn’t tell. But when they saw the spearheads, they all understood that they needed to help protect that village. All but one.
	my friends decided to stay the night, and I built them cabins with thunder’s help. I put their camouflage uniforms inside, and made their beds. When I showed their cabins to them, they were pretty impressed. By which I mean, the most impressed I’ve ever seen anyone in my whole life. When they moved into their cabins, they were all assigned an arrow to work with. The different arrows had different colored tags. They got to go to the arrow camp of tents, and pick the arrow they wanted, so I guess they weren’t really assigned, they were picked, but anyway, the tags each arrow got were either blue, green, red, orange, or yellow. Bear got red, Avery got orange, Erin got yellow, Conor got green, and James got blue. Then, we held a test to see what rank each human deserved. The test was, first, if you could spend a night with your arrow without killing it, then, if you could survive a night in the forest. If you killed your arrow, you would be banished. If you didn’t you made it to the next level. then, the best night surviver got the commander rank, and the others were troop commanders, which were in control of troops of arrows. The troop color was the color of the troop commander’s arrow’s tag.
	the test was to take place next week, so people would have not to much time, but a little bit of time, to prepare. I was already designated for general, and Aisling was our planner, but the rest was undecided, so I decided to hang around in the window room. I personally thought James is going to do well, because of what he used to do out in the streets, because he used to live on the streets, and he would get along so well, and then he got adopted, and raised, so he’s been through a lot, so I really did think he was going to do well.
	I decided it was a good time to hunt, so I got my camouflage on, and went through our stone gate. It was complicated, because the only way to open it was to pull a lever on the inside, which activated gears that opened the gate. If you wanted to get back in, you had to ring a bell, and then get authorized by someone inside. Of course, only we knew to ring the bell, and I don’t think enemies would walk up and ring the bell, but it ensures that outsiders can’t open the gate.
	I stepped out, and the metal spring we had put inside the door closed the gate. When the gate was safely closed behind me, I went to the part of the river that wasn’t blocked off by the wall. I started looking around for deer, and wished we had the kind of game that the tower island chain had. They were pretty bad people, because they were trying to invade the whole of expansed, the continent that moonland and the tower chain were in. They had managed to take the west coast of stella, the outermost country that surrounded most of expansed. then, there was solis, the country west of us, then us, then fortissimum, the strongest country of all. Fortissimum had banned all hunting of arrows, and the most common pet was an arrow.
	just then, I saw two deer standing on the other side of the river. I shot both of them, and hauled them back to the gate. I rang the bell, and went inside, then brought the deer to thunder, who cooked them, and we had the first deer for lunch.
	before dinner, I decided to make some bolistas using some reinforced bowstring from wing, some wood, and a bit of metal for the projectiles. This kind of bolista, the castle breaker, was meant to penetrate even the castellum, the main fortress of the tower chain. The biggest threat of the tower chain though, was Draco Inferno. It was their biggest and most deadly ship, and it could obliviate smaller ships just by running into them. It was such a powerful ship, that, when any other ship ever tried to confront it, it essentially crushes it.They also have Draco In Frigore, a ship a little small than the Draco Inferno, and Draco Vulcani, a ship the size of Draco In Frigore. once, a ship called Draco Glaciei attacked the beach of stella, but the ship was destroyed by trebuchets from stella hurling flaming, oil soaked hunks of cotton. Since the ships name was ship of ice in latin, it didn’t do well with fire. After the sinking of Draco Glaciei, Stella became the main defense against the tower chain.
	I decided I would try to defend the village if the invasion ever came this far. I had finished making one castle breaker, which I don’t think would actually penetrate the castellum, but we should be hopeful. When it was dinner time, we ate the other deer I had caught, and started talking about how I caught all the things I did. I just said I was gifted at hunting. When dinner was done, I went out to hunt for the next day, and told Aisling to stay at the gate. I went out and caught one more deer, then went back to the gate and rang the bell.Chapter 6

It was the week of the test, and there was only one day until the test. I was getting things ready, not that there was much to get ready, but still. I made the tents for James, Conor, Erin, Avery, and bear, and made a ladder on the side of the wall, so we could climb up. When I finished the ladder, I went to the window room, and looked at the calendar I put up before. I had three days until I had to go home. Good thing thing the test only took two. I got all the people together, and reminded them that the test was tomorrow. That meant I would go home right after the test. I laid down on my bed, and thought about if I should run away, or just keep going at intervals. I decided I would run away, and that I would go back sometimes, to get supplies. I got out of bed, and went to work on another castle breaker. I actually finished it in two hours, and then I started making a pivoting system. I finished the pivoting system in an hour, and put one of the castle breakers on it.
	it was getting dark, so I went out to hunt, and well I was outside, I found a dead arrow. There were no people out in the forest except for us. Which meant one of my friends had killed it. I was not happy.
	the next day, when I announced the test, I also announced that there was a traitor in our midst, and that they had killed an arrow. That days test was only a night test, so everybody was free to do whatever they felt like doing for the first part of the day. I decided to go out and hunt, with thunder, who had grown to the size that I could ride him at. I decided to try flying, and asked him if it was OK, and he did his happy jump thing, and I guess that meant yes, because he didn’t protest when I got on his back.
	when I got on his back, he immediately started running, and I held my arms tight around his neck, and then he started flapping his wing slowly. then, suddenly, he gave a very strong flap, and we were in the air. We started to fly higher, and we eventually got to the point where we could see the whole village.I decided hunting wasn’t a priority, and kept flying with thunder. We had been flying for about an hour, when I saw something in the woods on Aisling’s side of the river. It looked like an army of neon wolves. Not pack, but army. We flew down, and inside the village, and warned everybody. We dispatched some troops of arrows, and Aisling and I flew, and shot our fireballs at the wolves. I had said there was an army of wolves, I was wrong. It was more like twelve armies. I told thunder to shoot fireballs at the wolves, and he took out a few hundred with a few fireballs, but there was still somewhere around ten thousand. No matter what we did, there were still too many wolves to fight off, unless we did something absolutely brutal to them, that would also destroy the environment. But we had to do it.
	Aisling and I flew up in the air, and got into position. We ordered all the arrows to get out of the battle field, and we fired. The fireballs flew down, and hit the ground right next to each other. The whole area the wolves covered erupted into flames. The ground exploded. There was a huge mushroom shaped cloud that shot up into the sky. And when the smoke cleared, there was a huge crater where the wolves used to be. There was no more forest within a mile on that side of the river. All that was there was the smoking rubble. then, the spearheads did there repair thing, and the forest was back. But no living thing could have survived the explosion. We all went back to the village, and had lunch. James made some remarks on the blast, but all I said was, “nothing could have survived that.” And it’s true. We killed a bunch of innocent creatures to protect our selves.
	it was the test afternoon, and everybody was settling in their tents for the night. I reminded them of what the test was about, and they all acknowledged, and then, I told them if anybody killed their arrow, the would be banished for life. then, I went back to my house, and Aisling to her’s, and we slept. I didn’t know this was happening at the time, but I was informed later. bear, as soon as I went to bed, killed his arrow, and made sure all the blood was on his tent. He covered the whole of it with the arrows blood, and placed the body outside the entrance to the tent. And then, he slept.
	when I woke up, I went outside to see how good everybody did. And when I looked at bears tent, I nearly threw up because it was so disgusting. Then I saw the dead arrow outside his tent. I muttered something ungood, and stepped inside the tent. It wasn’t as bad as I expected, all I found was bear, holding a bloody knife in his hand, while sleeping. I whacked him on the head with a stick, and said, “get up”
	he smirked as he got up, and walked out of his tent. As everybody else got out of bed, they all passed bear dirty looks. Everybody gathered in front of my house, and I announced that bear would be banished for life, and that we would have a funeral for his arrow. We gathered up his arrow, and sent bear away. we got everything ready for the arrow’s funeral. I readied a coffin, and slowly lifted the arrow into it.
	suddenly, I knew who killed the arrow outside. It was bear. He was dangerous. He was bad. I lowered the lid of the coffin on, and went over to where Aisling, Erin, and Avery were digging the grave. I offered to help, and they let me. I told them about the dead arrow outside the walls, and how I figured out that bear did that too. I also told them that I couldn’t believe that bear was once my friend, and that we used to hang out together. I truly can not believe I used to hang out with such an ungood person. I mean, he killed two arrows, and made sure I knew, and smirked as he was about to get punished for his crime.
	after the grave was dug, I slowly lowered the arrow in to the grave. I bid it goodbye from the world, and swore I would get revenge.And I really hoped I would. I went to my house, and noted that that day was the last day here, before I had to return home for a while.
	Aisling came into the window room with me, and sat down next to me. She grabbed my hand, and said that I would definitely get revenge. I smiled, and said, “do you know what this reminds me of?”
“no” she said, “what?”
“when the storm hit” I said.
“oh yeah” said Aisling, “it reminds me of that too”
I laid down on the bed, and pulled the covers over my head. Aisling sat on the bed next to me, and grabbed my hand again, and I squeezed it as hard as I could. I absolutely could not forgive bear for what he did. It was unforgivable. Absolutely unforgivable. I got out of bed, and made a wooden carving of bear, and told thunder to blast it with all his power. Thunder rose up in the air, and shot it, and a mushroom cloud, not nearly as big as the wolf one, rose up, and the carving of bear was no where to be seen. I made another, slightly bigger one, and told thunder to do the same thing to it. And he did. I kept doing this, each time making the carving a little bit bigger, and by carving seven, I had attracted a big crowd, cheering when I finished each carving, and cheering each time thunder blew one up. I had made twelve more carvings by lunch time, and all but three were blown up. That meant after lunch, well thunder blew stuff up, I could just keep carving. But I also had to watch thunder blow them up, because it was one of my forms of revenge. For lunch, we had some deer I caught, and then, we got back to work on blowing up bear.
	we had blown up fifty more carvings of bear when the sun started setting, and I reminded everybody of what the next test was. They would go outside the walls, and spend the night in the forest, and then, after that, the ranks would be assigned. I would climb the ladder, and keep an eye on them. If one them got in trouble, I would help, and then leave them be for the rest of the night.
	when the sky started changing color, I told everybody to go out the gate, and pick a spot for the night. Avery picked a tree, Erin picked a clearing, Conor picked the base of a tree, and James picked a tree. I couldn’t really see why Erin would pick such a vulnerable spot, but I guess she thought it was good, or perhaps, she knew it was vulnerable, so she picked it to show off her survival skills more. anyway, Avery immediately started gathering edible berries, and when she had picked enough, she went back to her tree. She found a good branch, and started eating her berries.
	meanwhile, Erin, in her clearing, also started gathering berries, and gathered a little bit less the Avery. She went back to the clearing, and ate her berries.
	Conor was at the base of his tree, and he shot a goose by the water, and then his arrow helped him cook it. I guess he was the only one that remembered he had an arrow.
	James wasn’t in his tree when I looked, instead, he was on his way to his tree carrying a deer on his shoulders. ‘wow’ I thought, as he climbed the tree, still with the deer. then, he cut the deer in half, and. His arrow cooked one half of it, for James, and ate the other half himself. I guess he remembered he had an arrow that needs nourishment.
	I was thinking about how James thought of everything, when I heard a scream coming from Erin’s direction. I looked over, and saw a pack of neon wolves attacking her. I yelled at them, and when they turned to look, thunder shot them with fireballs. Erin thanked me, and I went back inside the village, and back up to the walls.
	when I had finished my shift of watching, I called Aisling up, and went over to my house. On the way, I passed bears tent. I told thunder that he could blow it up the next day. I went to the window room of my my house, and looked out the window. I started thinking about how good James did in the time that I watched him. I started trying to dream about something, and soon enough, I started dreaming about the wolf attack. As I was dreaming, I suddenly thought of how many arrows we killed in that explosion. then, I started dreaming about trapping arrows in some sort of enclosure, and then blasting each atom of their body into pieces. I started having even more disturbing dreams after that, like bear taking all arrows captive, and then me and thunder blasting everything within a thirty mile radius sky high. then, I sat on the ground, and got blown up myself, along with all my friends who were taking the test. I suddenly jolted awake as we got blown up a third time in my dream, and found out that it was morning.
	when I had gotten all my stuff together, which wasn’t much, because it was only my bow and arrows, I went outside, and told everybody to come back in. When everybody was back inside, I had a quick discussion about who should be commander, and we decided that James should be. When we came back out, we announced that James would be commander, and everybody else would be troop commander. Avery was commander of the orange troop, Erin of the yellow, and Conor of the green.
	after everybody was assigned their troops, we decided we would build some outposts closer to wing. The outpost would be manned by James and the blue troop.
	they would choose a spot by the village, and build there. The spot that James picked was a spot sort of close to the hole, but not too close, and we started building a building there. It was basically a big tent, with different sections inside. James would be able to call in any troop he wanted, unless they were already in combat. But since I was the general, I could call in any troop from anywhere. Which meant I had complete control over the entire military of arrow village. Once we had set up the outside of the tent, we started putting sticks across the ceiling. After that, we started hanging cloth over some of the sticks, to divide the different rooms. When James moved in, he claimed the room he wanted, and the rest of the rooms were for the troops. The blue troops moved in, and I went back to my house. But before I actually went back, I made sure thunder blew up bear’s tent.Chapter 7

It was a nice day in the village, which I had named arrow, and I was out on a trip to Fortissimum, to talk to them about making an alliance. I was flying, because walking would take too long, and I couldn’t get a horse unless I went to the village and said I was going to Fortissimum, which they would not like. Thunder ran down a cleared strip of land that we used for a runway, but only for long trips, since the takeoff that it provided was slower, but took less energy. Once we were in the air, I let the wind ripple my clothes, and for that moment, I felt like everything else just melted away, to let me enjoy the moment. But that thought disturbed me, because what about Aisling. I didn’t want her to melt away. And Avery, and Erin, and James, and Conor. I didn’t want them to melt away either. So I decided to try not to feel like the rest of the world was melting away.
	after two hours or so of flying, we were finally in fortissimum. Now we could negotiate about the alliance. I didn’t know if they would except the alliance just because we were against the arrow hunt like they were, but I hoped they would. Because we needed an ally.
	I was planning to land on one of the castle roofs, because I would be easily spotted. The castle of Fortissimum had a mostly flat roof, so it would be easy to take off and land. We were flying over the forest when I saw the wall of fortissimum.That meant we still had a ways to go, but at least we were in Fortissimum. We had been flying for about and hour, when I began to see the castle. It was a huge two hundred foot tall castle, with a mostly flat roof, with a few towers with turrets. We landed, and then, suddenly, we heard a door open, and looked toward the sound. A tall man was coming out the door on one of the towers, and he was wearing a long black robe. He addressed him self as ghost, and invited us inside. I asked him why he was so welcoming, and he said it was because ‘anyone against the arrow hunt is our ally.’ I guess the visit was pointless. ‘But I guess it will be nice to see the kingdom’ I thought.
“wait a minute, how do you know we’re against the arrow hunt?” I said.
“oh! We send out scouts to the different nations to see how things are going.” Said  ghost.
I went inside, following him, until we came to a room with windows, looking out the front of the castle. When we were inside, I saw some other people inside. There was a girl about my age, along with a boy, who was about fifteen. The girl introduced herself as spirit, and the boy as smoke. After they introduced themselves, they introduced their pets. Spirit’s pet arrow was named sleek, and smoke’s was named soot. After everybody was introduced, ghost suggested that I go with spirit so she could show me something cool, so I went. I was completely unprepared for what the cool thing was. Spirit grabbed my hand and basically pulled me through the halls, and to a big wide field. And on the field was something epic. On the field were alicorns. White horses with wings and horns. It was epic.
“wow” I said.
“I know, right?” Said spirit, “wanna ride one?”
“I- I- I-” I said. I had no idea what to think.
“let me show you mine” said spirit.
I followed her to one of the magnificent alicorns. She got on, and suggested that I rode on thunder to follow her. Her alicorn, which she said she had named shadow, started running. Thunder started running. And before we knew it, we were in the air. She took her hands off of shadow’s mane, and stretched them up in the air, her blond hair waving in the wind. After about a minute of flying, she pointed out something on the ground. There was a big army the ground, and we flew down next to it. Some of them were holding red flags, and the rest of them were holding swords or bows.
“do you have to bring that beast everywhere?” Said one of the soldiers to spirit. then, before anyone could do anything, shadows horn began to glow, and shadow scraped her hoof on the ground, and then, as if by magic, the soldier started smoking, and then basically melted away. I was very surprised. Very, surprised. Spirit suggested that we go before shadow got mad at any of the other soldiers. I agreed, and we went back to the alicorn field.
	it had been a few days, and I was in the room with all the windows, and ghost, apparently the king of Fortissimum, told me that they would keep me updated on all the news of the world. When all the goodbyes were said, I boarded thunder, and took off.
	after a few hours of flying, I was home. It had been a few days since I took off to go to Fortissimum, and I was glad to be home. The sun was setting, so I decided to go to sleep.Chapter 8

The next day, I woke up to the sound of a horn. A war horn. definitely from wing. ‘that can’t be good’ I thought. And I was right. James came running, and rang the gates bell. Aisling opened the gate, and James told us what happened. apparently, his outpost was attacked by a bunch of knights from wing, and they set the whole place on fire. He barely got out alive, and none of the arrows did. I definitely needed revenge on bear. I was certain he had caused this attack.



End of part 1Part 2



The war*Chapter 9

If there was any respect for bear left in me at that time, it was not there any more. He had killed so many arrows. I really needed revenge. Really really really really really really needed revenge. More than anything else. I would not sleep until I got revenge.
	We were officially at war with wing. If they won, we’d all be executed for treason. But if we won, anybody who killed an arrow would be executed for treason. After the habit breaking, which was a period of time, over which people would break the habit of killing arrows. After the habit breaking, if we won, any arrow killings would be punished by death. If we lost the war, there would be essentially no hope for the arrows. the war that had started was not too good for the rest of the continent either, because the tower chain’s invasion had taken all of stella, and was moving slowly into solis. If they got through solis, there would be no hope for wing or arrow, because we would already be fighting our own war. If we won our war, we could have used the arrows to fight the tower chain troopers. We were in a not very good situation.
	we decided we would assemble all the arrows, and try to take wing by force. We might end up having to bomb it using our mushroom attack. We hoped it wouldn’t come to that though. We assembled all of our troops inside the village walls, and Conor opened the gate, then quickly got back to the front of his troop. I got in front of the whole army, and led them over to the burning outpost. After we had settled down, I told everybody to get into their camouflage uniforms, and pick a tree. After everybody had picked their tree, we slept surprisingly peacefully. For the first part of the night.
	during the night, something very surprising happened. I saw smoke rising from the village of wing, with and orange glow beneath it. I went inside to check it out, and was surprised to see the army of wing attacking the citizens. I guess the citizens caused an uprising, because the wing army never attacked citizens, unless they had a good reason. I woke thunder, and told him to fire a few shots into the army, and the army was suddenly very confused. I told thunder to take a few more shots. As soon as the fifth shot hit, the army was very scared. I guess we did our job, because the army attacked no more citizens.
	the next day, everybody was eager to get into battle, except for James, who absolutely hated it. He said to me that he would only fight if he got a reward, and so I told him that he would get a whole entire camp to himself if we won. He seemed to like that, so I went with it.
	after a few hours at camp, with no attacks, I decided then was the time to strike. I assembled all the troops, and told everybody the plan. The plan was, we would have some of the arrows go through, and cause a diversion, well more arrows attacked from above. Wing would most likely be loaded with weapons, since we were at war, so we would have to steer clear of the bolistas and other likely weapons. We would also have a special squad of weapon destroyers, who would perch on top of the wall, while shooting at all the weapons. Once everybody understood the plan, I gave the diversion squad the go signal, and we started the attack.
	the diversion squad entered through the hole, and started randomly starting fires. As expected, Braiden the big, and some other people went for the arrows, and then, we attacked from above. Everything went as expected. As soon as we entered the air, bolistas were upon us, but we mostly avoided them. Conor and Avery rode on thunder’s parents, and we attacked. Behind Conor and Avery, there were arrows of flying arrows, and we started firing down. We were essentially bombing the village, and we were doing a good job of it. That was until Avery got blown out of the air. She fell and fell, with thunder’s father not far behind. I used thunder’s wing to catch Avery, but I couldn’t catch thunder’s father in time. As soon as he hit the ground, thunder’s father was stabbed to death by Braiden the big, but not before we scorched his beard with a fireball. Thunder did his not as big mushroom cloud on one of the bolistas, and it went up in flames. I congratulated him on his shot, and led everybody in a big arrow shape towards Braiden the big’s house, and did our mushroom cloud on it. Braiden was very mad about his house, and threw an ax at us, which an arrow from the orange troop. I got revenge on Braiden pretty quick though, because I took out his personal supply shed, which exploded with a lot more force than I was expecting. I soon found out why. It was full of oil. With that said, let’s get back to the battle. Braiden was enraged, and took an oil container from somebody else’s house, lit it on fire, and threw it at us. It exploded in the middle of the green troop, taking out about five or six arrows. After that, we just started shooting a bunch of fireballs at Braiden, who deflected them with his sword. We actually got a few hits in, but they only hit his legs. apparently, a big part of wings population was against the hunting of arrows, because Braiden had to send a messenger to beak, a nearby village, to get help. The citizens armed themselves with whatever they could find, which included daggers, broken windows, sacks of potatoes, and attacked the army. With the help of the arrows, it seemed like it was a winning battle. Until the army of beak came. That really turned the tables. The beak army was very strong, and forced us to retreat. But with us, came most of the population of wing.
	it was during our retreat that I noticed the biggest mistake I had made while we were building our village. There was no hospital. none the less, all the people with medical experience were helping hurt people. then, I noticed something else. I could probably get some of the able men to fight for us, and that could help us. A lot.
	the medics set up a makeshift hospital inside the walls, with a bunch of tents, most of which were empty. It took a long time for me to notice what our attack had cost, and when I finally did, it was inside a hospital tent.
	I was inside, looking straight into the eyes of a very young girl, who was maybe four years old, who was impaled in the leg by the sword of one of beak’s troopers. I thought about if I knew the girl. If I did, I didn’t know it. I held her hand tight, as I noticed that we had hurt innocent people during that attack. Only now there were no innocent people people inside the village to hurt. The last thing I noticed, I noticed when the little girl died. I noticed that we had probably killed more people like the little girl, we just didn’t see. I decided that all woman and children were to go beyond the village, and stay there with some arrows to keep them safe. They could not stay in the village, because that would only get them killed. I decided that that day, we would start building a dwelling for them to stay in while the war lasted. When it was over, they could come back. If there was a village to come back to. and I was praying every day for help. Every day.
	I was always building defenses for the village. always. I could not afford to lose the village. I could not. I had built five pivoting castle breakers, and was working on crossbows on sands when I heard it. It was unmistakable. The march of the beak army. I yelled at everybody to get to their station, and I started flying with thunder. Then I saw them. A big army heading straight for arrow. Led by bear. ‘I hate him’ I thought, as I signaled thunder to blow him to pieces.Chapter 10

Thunder obediently sent bear flying into the sky with a mushroom cloud, along with a few other members of the army, and then flew a little bit lower. I saw what looked like the whole beak army heading for arrow, and took a few shots at them, before returning to arrow, and warning the others of the size of the attack. They reacted accordingly, and we sent out a few guards, to warn us of when they got close.
	inside the village was pandemonium. Everybody was rushing the woman and children to the safety camp, and members of the army were preparing for the attack. After all the woman and children were safely out,—all woman and children except for me, Conor, James, Avery, Erin, and Aisling of course— we set up tripwires everywhere, so if the village was taken, the tripwires would stop some of the beak army. After all the tripwires were set, we started loading all the crossbow stands, and putting more arrow sheaths by them. After they were ready, we waited for the signal that the beak army was close. A shot by an arrow. Once we saw the signal, action!
	it was a long wait for the signal, but we were very ready. I made sure everybody was heavily armed, and had camouflage armor on. I sent some more arrows into the air to fire on any of the beaks they came across. Any and every.
	it was fifteen minutes before the signal came. But once it did, everybody sprung into action. James led all the troops out to meet the beak army, and I led the air force. immediately, it became clear that we had underestimated the beak army. They were all armed with crossbows, and swords, and they all had very protective armor. Even though it wasn’t camouflage. As soon as the army came into view, they started shooting flaming arrows at the village. The crew inside pumped water from the river to the fires, and kept them subdued enough that they wouldn’t burn down the whole entire village.
	we took control of the situation pretty easily, except for the part where we were being attacked. We had stopped all the fires in the village, and the troops had so far survived entirely, except for a few deaths. The battle was very intense though, and the death toll was soon to change. I fired a few shots at the army, but they made little difference. After about an hour of battle, it was clear that the beak army wanted more than just victory as a prize, because a large amount of the deaths in the battle were arrows. Speaking of arrows, the beak army had set the forest on fire with their flaming arrows, and it was burning a lot. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot.
	after one whole day and night of fighting, there was somewhere around an equal number of deaths on each side. But that was soon to change. We were beginning to be over powered by the beak army, but we did not give up. We tried a few mushroom clouds in some places, which changed the battle, but only a little bit. then, very suddenly, some flaming oil barrels came flying at us. They were from catapults, and they started exploding in the air, and all we could do was shoot at them, and hope for the best.
	after a lot of oil barrels, our army had gone down quite a lot, but we still had a few tricks up our sleeves. one, was that the beak army didn’t know about our crossbows yet, and paid no attention to them. That was quite a mistake for them, because the amount of people in their army went down a lot when we started using the crossbows. then, while the beak army was paying attention to the crossbows, the air force attacked, bringing their numbers down again. But then, the barrels started coming back. They blew a lot of the arrows out of the sky, and there were a lot of people on the ground dead too. finally, I gave the order to retreat. only, it was to trick the beak army.
	then, Aisling and I flew up really high in the air, and when everybody was out of the area, we used our big mushroom cloud trick. boom. The whole entire army was gone. done. non-existent. dead. We had defeated them. But it took a lot of effort.
	the makeshift hospital was in complete chaos, as the medics brought people from everywhere to help them. I looked around for anybody I knew personally, and was very surprised to see my mother in one of the I.C.U. tents. I asked her what happened, but then, it became obvious. Even before she started to speak. I saw that she was burned all over. It was one of the oil bombs. She told me she had been burned by flaming oil falling from the sky. I didn’t even know she came with the others, and now she’s in the I.C.U. all because of me. ‘at least she won’t die’ I thought to my self, as three doctors came in to tend to her. I left the tent, and went around to see if anybody else was hurt. I met Avery in one of the tents, just waking up, with an arrow stuck in her chest, right next to her shoulder. I thought it looked pretty grizzly on the outside, because her shirt was completely soaked with blood. But then, she took out the arrow, and took off her shirt to show me the real scar. It was absolutely disgusting. It was basically a hole, covered with blood, with more blood around it. She said that the doctor said she was going to have that scar for the rest of her life. wow.
	true, that battle was intense, but something far more intense was about to happen. Something very ungood. Something that would change the village forever.
	we were planning a big attack on wing, to try to end things quick, and our original plan was just to blow it into kingdom come, but we wanted all the supplies there. So we were thinking up another plan. So far, the plan was to set all the houses on fire,but that wouldn’t work, because we wanted the village intact. We decided we would kidnap Braiden the big, and then, use our mushroom cloud explosion on part of the forest on the opposite side of wing, and then say that we would stick him in the middle of one of those if he didn’t surrender. And we would keep our promise.
	once we had come up with that plan, we started thinking about how we would kidnap Braiden. It would be hard, because he would most likely be very heavily guarded. We decided to send in one person, with an arrow flying up above. Since the village would be mostly deserted, the person who was walking through would meet little resistance. When they got to Braidens temporary home, the arrow flying above would take out the guards, and the person would go in, and take Braiden. Once Braiden was kidnapped, we would bring him unarmed, and into the air, and proceed with the plan.
	before we got a chance to pick the one to kidnap Braiden, wewere suddenly shaken very hard. I left the planning room, and ran outside, only to find the village in flames. I called everybody outside, and we pumped water from the river to the fire. We eventually put out the fire, but it had burned a big chunk of the wall. I told everybody to be extra vigilant, because we were very vulnerable. I started making a makeshift wall substitute. After the substitute was made, I got everybody together to choose the kidnapper. It was a close race between Conor and James, but James won.
	we told him all the details of the plan, and he acknowledged the whole thing. then, he picked the arrow that he would be taking with him. After that, we told him that he would be entering through the hole, and that he would not hurt anybody. If he did, he would be found out. He acknowledged the plan, and went to his tent for the night, and I did the same.
	the next day, we were preparing for the mission, when Aisling ran over to me, and tugged on my shirt. I asked her what was wrong, and she said spirit had come to see me. I ran after Aisling, and to spirit. She said that Fortissimum had offered to give us forces to fight. I didn’t think that was a good idea, and plus, I wanted to prove the worth of arrows. I said no, and she went back to Fortissimum. But at least I knew they were real allies.
	after that, I went back to where James was waiting, and gave him the signal to go. I sent the arrow up in the air after him, and that is where things started going wrong. first, the arrow was shot out of the air by a bolista, then, James, as soon as he got inside, screamed for help. I knew something was going very wrong, so I went in, on thunder’s back, and found James, back against the wall, threatened by several soldiers armed with spears. I blasted each and every one out of life, and told James to get on thunders back with me. After he had gotten on, I gave him a lift to Braiden’s place of residence, and thunder took out all the guards. After the guards were all safely dead, James went in.
	after a minute, James was back out, with Braiden tied up, dragged behind him. then, we brought him up into the air, and Aisling came up to join us. After that, I told Braiden the big what we were going to do. I gave the signal for thunder and cloudy— Aisling’s spearhead— to do the mushroom cloud.They did, and Braiden nearly fell off thunder’s back out of shock as all the ground was blown to kingdom come. then, we told him the options. Of course, he said he would never surrender the village, so we brought him to the middle of an undestroyed part of the forest, and tied him to a tree. I asked him if he had any last words, and they were, ‘I really hate you’ I was a little disappointed, but still, he’s a disappointing person. I went back to thunder, and then, thunder, cloudy, Aisling, and I went into the sky, and got into position to attack. We shot the fireballs, and they both hit the ground next to each other, near Braiden’s feet. then, the ground erupted, sending everything within a mile into oblivion. then, cloudy and thunder did their out everything back together trick, and they even put Braidens body back together. I said I’d rather not have his body in existence, so they both shot him again, destroying his body, but nothing else. then, we went back to the village, and asked the remaining army of wing if there were any opposed to my being chief of the village. They all said no, which did not surprise me, and went to their homes.Chapter 11

It turned out, beak had a bigger army than we thought. because, only a few days after taking wing, the beak army led what looked like their whole army. But then again, we thought we saw the whole army before, and if the rest of the army was there that day, what we thought was the whole army, would be half. But it could be a smaller fraction. I sure hoped that the attacking army was the whole remaining army of beak, because if it wasn’t, we were in trouble. But then, I noticed they had something with them. They had cavalry. ‘oh no’ thought. I was standing on top of the village wall of wing when the barrel hit. It blew up that part of the wall, and I fell. Thunder caught me, but I was still completely out of it. I was carried back to the hospital, and when I woke up a day later, I was informed that the battle was still raging.
	I decided I better get the troops from fortissimum here then, so that they could help with the battle. I told my mother where I was going, and got on thunder’s back. I went to the run way, and told thunder to fly. He obediently started running, and before we knew it, we were in the air.
	after several hours of flying, we were flying over the the fortissimum wall. We were finally in fortissimum. We kept flying until we were at fortissimum castle. Ghost came out the door, and asked me why I was here. I said that our village needed help, and we could really use their troops. Ghost brought me to the army’s training field, and yelled at the army, and brought them to attention. He announced that the army would be going into battle with me, and that I would be their leader, no matter what happened. The army let out a very loud battle cry, and got into position. The army looked a lot more intimidating in formation. Ghost told me to lead them in the right direction. I got back on thunder’s back, and thunder started walking towards wing. The army started marching behind me, the flags waving in the wind, the volume of the march incredible. We marched to the front of fortissimum castle, and the citizens of the castle cheered as we marched into the forest. The trees seemed to bend down to shade us from the sun as we marched through. Even the neon wolves retreated at the sight. Mice and rangers scurried out of the way as we marched through.
	apparently, the army was very skilled, because when some neon wolves did decide to attack, they were dead in a minute. When the sun started setting, we made a camp, and I told them I would go hunting for food. I went through the forest until I came across a herd of deer. I ordered some of the soldiers to help me carry them back once I had killed them. I brought the deer back, with the help of the soldiers, and thunder cooked it. Every soldier got a small portion of the food, since there were so many soldiers, and not that many deer. After we had eaten all the deer, we pitched tents to sleep in.
	after a few days and nights, we were past the fortissimum wall, but not quite to arrow. then, I saw something bad. A big cloud of smoke in the air by arrow. I told them we had to hurry, and they sped up their march.
	by the time we got to the river, I noticed the cloud wasn’t coming from the village, but from the beak army’s camp. But there was still a big battle going on in wing. The walls were completely gone, and there weren’t many houses left either. I led the army across the river, and then heard a march that wasn’t coming from my army. Another part of the beak army came. I led the army of fortissimum in to battle, and the battle was very intense when we joined. The armies collided, and fell upon each other, and I took thunder out of the middle of the whole thing, and led the remaining arrows into battle. Some of the arrows were shot down immediately, but others weren’t. Most of the arrows were, though. I kept shooting at the beak army, but it made little difference.
	after a few hours of battle, I decided to go check on the hospital. I was not prepared for what I would find. The hospital was not big enough for all of the wounded. I helped the medics build extra tents, and walked through to see how many people I knew died, or got hurt. I was walking through the hospital, when I saw an alicorn coming in for a landing. Spirit was on it, and she was holding a sword. She said she came here to fight, but I didn’t let her. I said she should help the medics. She did, and when she left to go to one of the tents, I was surprised to see Erin running toward me. She told me to follow her, and I did. But then, as I got closer to the destination, I heard a familiar voice from inside one of the tents. As I got closer, I recognized it as Aisling’s. I followed it until I found the tent, and when I looked through the opening, I wished I hadn’t. Aisling was inside, with three arrows in her body. One in each arm, and one in her leg. I went inside, and asked Aisling if she was OK. She said she was, but I didn’t think she looked OK. But if she thought she was OK, she probably was. then, I went to catch up with Erin.
	When we were at our destination, Erin showed me something she had built. She said it was a blast shield that she had built, and that we could use it to shield ourselves from the explosion force if we used thunder’s mushroom cloud. I reminded her that we had troops from another country that could easily turn on us if it looked like we were attacking them. She then agreed another solution was better. I decided that it would be good to try to take out some areas of the beak army with mushroom clouds. Erin agreed that it would be a good idea. I got on thunder’s back, and flew him above the beak army, and started blowing them up. It actually made a bit of a difference. But the battle was still raging. then, yet another part of the beak army came. Their army was really huge. I told thunder to fire right into their front line, and he did, which brought down the size of the approaching army considerably. I said he did a good job, and then we continued bombarding the approaching army. Once we had diminished the approaching army by about half, we decided just to go to beak, and mushroom the military base. I told my plan to Aisling, and she approved it.
	I told thunder the plan, and we flew to beak in about a half hour. When. We got there, we saw another reinforcement. Army preparing to leave, and blew it to kingdom come. After that, we flew around, looking for the military base, but then, a bolista projectile came wizzing past us. I looked to the direction of the bolista, and saw the military base there. We took out the bolistas, and then blew up the military base. then, we started flying back to arrow. The battle was still raging when we got back, but at least we knew no more troops would be coming from the enemy. But then, the catapults started doing their thing. The village went up in smoke, and all the walls were gone before we could put out all of the fires.
	there was still a fairly big army left after all the bombings were done, but not so big the fortissimum army couldn’t beat them. The battle lasted for about one more day, and then the rest of beak’s army was gone. dead. non-existent. The war was over. But not the battle. We still had to go through the battle field and rescue everybody we needed to, fix everything, and thank the fortissimum army for helping us. We started fixing everything by going through the battle field, and rescuing everybody we could. I was surprised that most of the beak army was still alive. To make sure nothing bad could become of it, I ordered thunder to burn the rest of the beak army. After the beak army went up in smoke, we returned to the rescue. There were to many in need of help to to rescue them all. We rescued a lot of them though. I decided to go to the field hospital to make sure everybody there was OK. But then, I heard thunder whimper. And watched him slump to the ground. Somebody had shot thunder. The beak army commander did nothing to cover up his crime. Thunder was not killed by the shot, but he was hurt. I took a sword from one of the dead fortissimum soldiers, and stabbed the beak commander. I brought thunder to the hospital, with help from the fortissimum army commander, and brought him to Aisling, who had partially recovered from all of the arrows. She did her best to bandage thunder’s back, and laid him down on a bed to rest. I went over to where spirit was, and saw something horrible. She was leaning over a bed, with a very hurt patient in it. The patient was covered with blood, and had a giant gash in his side. Spirit was sweating, trying to take care of him, but I didn’t think there was any hope for the man. He was so bloody, and if he didn’t die from his wound, he would probably die of blood loss. After seeing what I did, I decided I wanted to take a break, by flying with thunder, but then I remembered what happened to thunder, and had no idea what to do. I decided to go survey the damage from the ground, and was horrified at the level of destruction caused by the battle. ‘this is bad’ I thought to my self, as I walked through the strip of land between arrow and wing. Wing was still burning, and there were only a few houses left, and besides the houses, and the cleared land, you would not be able to tell there used to be a village there. It would be impossible. I decided to wait until thunder was better to do any more surveying. I went back to my house, to find that the whole structure was spared. I was very surprised as to why the beak army would leave it untouched. But then again, it was right next to the river, and there were some scorch marks.



End of part 2*Part 3



The aftermathChapter 12

It was one month since the end of the war, and the ruins of wing were still smoldering. I was walking through the main street of wing, with thunder at my side, surveying it because thunder was now alright. The construction of a bigger, more powerful wall had started, and it would surround all of arrow and wing, plus a little bit more. I was very sad, because James had been knocked out by an oil barrel, and didn’t remember anything from before. I had tried to help him, but nothing worked. Erin’s blast shield had been put to use in making exploding oil barrels, and testing the amount of oil and air inside. Once, one of the bombs went off with so much force that it made a crater the size of a large tree. The rebuild had begun, and most of wing’s citizens were in the hospital, recovering. Those who weren’t were starting habit breaking. The habit breaking was actually going pretty well, and we only had one arrow death during it. There had been no other mishaps, except for when an unstable building collapsed when somebody rested their arm on it. We had burned down the rest of the walls of wing, and started building new ones, and building new houses for the citizens.
	after about a week, more of the citizens were out of the hospital, and starting the habit breaking. My mother was still in the hospital though. I did go to see her pretty frequently. I also visited fortissimum a few times. They were a big help in the rebuild. They helped build a lot of the houses, and tear down the walls of wing. The remaining army of fortissimum helped protect the village while we rebuilt it. I was walking through the remnants of wing, when spirit walked up to me, and asked me if I wanted to go fly around with her. I would have to be careful, since thunder’s back was still healing, but I agreed. We took off from what used to be the runway, and before we knew it, we were in the air, flying side by side. She asked me if we should go higher, but I told her we shouldn’t, because thunder was still healing. She said that we could stay low, and we started flying above the battle field. We looked at all of the destruction, and I told her a little bit about all the moments in the battle. She said that she wished she could fight, instead of helping the medics, but I told her that she was a big help.
	after our talk about the battle, I flew over to my house, and noticed that the scorch marks were gone. I was confused, but then thunder showed me that he could unscorch wood if it was already unscorched enough. I told him to unscorch all that he could, and he actually unscorched a lot of stuff. After the unscorching, I went to the hospital, to see how people were recovering. I found out that my mother was still in the I.C.U. she was not doing very well recovering.
	I also saw a few very young children in the hospital, with nasty injuries. luckily, most of the children’s injuries were not too serious. One of the injuries was, though. There was a boy about five years old, who had been crushed by a wall collapsing during one of the battles. He was in the I.C.U. tent next to my mother, and by the looks of the injury, I didn’t think he was going to get better. I was right. That boy died a day later.Chapter 13

It was seven days since the boy died, and that day was the day we were going to have a funeral for all the people who died in the battle. I didn’t think we were going to have enough time to get all the bodies ready, but we did. The funeral was in two hours, and I decided to go for a fly with thunder. I flew over the forest, and above the river, and we just kept following the river. After following the river for a few minutes, we came across something strange. We found an abandoned looking hut by the side of the river, and when we landed to look at it, an old woman came out, holding a wooden staff. I asked her what she was doing, and she said she was living. I told her I knew that, and then she took out a crossbow, and pointed it at thunder. She said there was a spearhead behind me, and I said I knew. She started pulling the trigger on her crossbow, but I took out my sword, and blocked her from shooting. She moved her crossbow, and I knocked it out of her hands with my sword. She swung her staff at me, but I easily blocked it with my sword. I told her to stop, or I could blow her to pieces with thunder, but she just said ‘yeah right’, so I instructed thunder to blow up the hut as demonstration. She then said that I wouldn’t dare do it to her, so I did.Chapter 14

It was an hour since the encounter with the crazy old lady, and I was back in arrow, getting ready for the funeral that was in thirty minutes. I was digging the big grave for all the dead soldiers, and it was almost done. When the grave was done, we would rest until the funeral. The grave was almost done when Avery came to me and told me that she had found something very important.
	when I got to where she had found it, I was astonished by the object. It was a tiny pile of dust. But not just any dust, alicorn dust. It was a magical dust that alicorns drop very rarely. The dust could be used in a potion that gave the drinker temporary flight. I carefully put all the alicorn dust in a bottle and out it safely inside my house. After it was safely out away, I went back to the hole, which was just about done. then, I went to where all the horse carriages with the dead people were. The horses were getting ready to carry the dead to the hole, and I brought over some flowers, and put them in one of the carriages. After the flowers were in, I went to the place where the first part of the funeral would take place. Aisling would be giving a speech, and then the burial would begin. I took s seat, and then Aisling began her speech.
“these soldiers have fought very hard” she said, “and the young were very hopeful for us. All the dead, did not die in vain. The soldiers fought valiantly, and we will remember their sacrifice forever.”
The crowd applauded, and she stepped off the stage. then, everybody went over to the hole, and the burial began. All the dead bodies were lifted out of the carriage, and put inside the hole. After that, everybody was asked to leave, as the buriers buried the bodies. I left with the crowd, and went to the hospital to see my mother. My mother was still in the I.C.U, but the burns were a little bit better. I told her about everything that happened in the past few days, and I even told her about the crazy old lady. She said that I was a very brave boy, and then fell asleep. I walked out, and went to my house, where spirit was waiting for me. I laid down on my bed, and spirit sat down beside me. She grabbed my hand, and I was glad for the support. I told her that the last few days were very stressful, and she did a good job of making me feel better. I was happy to have someone I could I could trust. Especially when one small thing could send the entire area of the village into oblivion. I decided I would savor this moment, and not let anything else get in the way.
	it was the day after the funeral, and I was helping some of the fortissimum people build a house, and I was helping two other people build the fireplace. I was helping place the bricks when thunder came and lightly bit my sleeve, which meant he wanted me to follow him. I followed him until I came across something I never thought I would ever see. A pile of alicorn dust, except it was the size of my house. I quickly looked around, and saw that nearly everybody in the village was staring at it. I told them that nobody could touch it, because alicorns were never big enough to drop a pile that big. I decided to leave it there, and see what happened. Bad idea.
	the next day, I saw some idiot getting a bunch of alicorn dust from the big pile, and I had to blow up the ground underneath him to get him to stop. After I had stopped him, I pulled him into the town square, and made him give all of the alicorn dust to me, and I threw it into the pile. I knew I shouldn’t execute him, and I didn’t, but I warned him that the next time he did something like that, he would get a more severe punishment. Much more severe.
	I sent him back to his house, and then went back to mine. When I was safely inside, I thought about all the pain and misery that I had caused. I guess it was for the good of the arrows, because if it weren’t for me, the arrow population would still be decreasing, but I still killed a lot of arrows in the battles, well, more like forced them to fly to their deaths.
	as I laid down in my bed, I started thinking more about how many human lives were lost. Maybe it was in return for all the arrows they had killed, maybe it was just the price of the battle, but either way, too many humans and arrows were lost during the battle. I just kept laying in bed until sleep came. And it was a long time before it did. I kept laying down, and in a few hours, I fell asleep.Chapter 15

When I woke up, I found myself not in my house, but somewhere else, but I couldn’t figure out where. It looked sort of like a dim forest, but I couldn’t figure out what forest it was. I looked around for any signs or clues, but I found none. I went around to one of the trees, and climbed it, to see if I could find anything useful. again, I found nothing. I climbed back down, and then suddenly noticed that thunder was nowhere to be seen. I yelled his name, but there was no answer. ‘great. Now I’m stuck in this really weird forest with no protection’ I thought. I don’t know if it was me thinking about having no protection or not, but I suddenly noticed a bow, and a sheath of arrows laying on the ground. I picked them up, and then went to what I thought looked like a safe place. It was a cave in the ground, with nothing inside that I could see, so I went in. Big mistake. Inside was a pack of neon wolves, and I ran as soon as I saw them. I notched an arrow in my bow, and shot one of them. It didn’t make much of a difference though. It felt like as soon as I killed one, another one just appeared in it’s place. then, something very weird happened. The trees started shattering. Bits of wood were flying everywhere, but the trees were still standing. then, the ground started bubbling. The bubbles were hit by wood from exploding trees, and when they popped, the released acid into the air. When one of the neon wolves made it through the big death trap, it lunged strait for my neck. I was just as surprised as it was when it’s teeth went strait through me, and into one of the flying pieces of wood. then, big snakes started slithering out of the bubbles when they popped, and every time they tried to bite me, they exploded into a bunch of tiny chocolate chips. Then, it started raining, and thank god, it was normal rain. But then, the rain started to get chopped up by the flying pieces of wood. It was crazy. As I tried to make sense of the exploding chocolate snakes, and shattering trees, something else happened. Braiden the big came flying in on top of a giant flying gecko. Braiden jumped off, just as the gecko transformed into a glowing green stick, and exploded. I tried to notch an arrow to shoot Braiden, but every time, the arrow just went through the bow string.
	after a minute of trying to notch an arrow, I gave up, and let the neon wolves finish him off. The sky suddenly started getting dark, and I wondered how the sun could set so fast, but then I noticed that there was no sun. suddenly, big sheets of water started falling, each one hitting the ground with tremendous force. After about thirty sheets of water, the ground was covered by a foot of water, and that was when I noticed that there were no more shattering trees, chocolate snakes, or acid bubbles. suddenly, I noticed the big black mass heading strait for the ground. ‘the sky is falling!’ I thought, as the black mass got closer. then, a bunch of giant fire-y explosions blew up the sky. then, I noticed the other giant blackness above it. then, the trees started shattering again, and the sky started blowing up. I ran back into the cave, hoping that it would provide at least some protection against the breaking world. then, I heard a hiss, and then watched as a large amount of the forest exploded. Another hiss. Another explosion. then, I started running, even though I didn’t want to, strait into the fire. I was being controlled by something. I ran strait into the fire, and then watched as another giant sheet of water fell onto all the flames, extinguishing everything immediately. then, I looked up to see that the third sky was about to explode. I ran back to the cave, hoping the sky wouldn’t reach it. then, the sky third exploded, unleashing the fourth sky on the world. then, I started running against my will, to a big metal plate. As soon as I touched it, the whole world around me seemed to explode, and I saw a big crater. then, I saw that almost everything was beginning to melt away. I looked up, and saw the sun, which used to be hidden behind all of the skies, as close to the earth as the moon was. then, I noticed why everything was melting. The sun was hot. And expanding, apparently. I ran to the cave as everything around me started melting. then, I got out of the cave, against my will, and watched the sun explode. The whole world was now in flames, and the fifth sky was descending upon me. I curled myself up in a ball on the ground, as the trees started shattering again, now shooting out flaming bits of wood. The sky started exploding, and then started crushing the trees. ‘definitely the end of the world’ I thought, as the big black mass continued to crush everything.
	suddenly, I noticed the shield laying on the ground next to me, and picked up. I held the shield in a defensive position, but then, it got really hot, and melted. Then, I let out a very shrill scream as the sky crushed the rest of the world, and then me. My last thought was one about how I had gotten there, and if my family knew or not. I decided that my last words should be about my family, so I said, “goodbye mom”
	but the end never came. It may have flattened me into a sheet of parchment paper, but I was one hundred percent living. My life flashed before my eyes, as I thought ‘a little late’Chapter 16

I woke with a start. This time not in a dream about the apocalypse. I realized that I was soaked in sweat, and that spirit was sitting beside me, gripping my hand tightly.
“what were you dreaming about?” Said spirit in a worried tone.
“so basically,” I said,” When I woke up, in the dream, I found myself not in my house, but somewhere else, but I couldn’t figure out where. It looked sort of like a dim forest, but I couldn’t figure out what forest it was. I looked around for any signs or clues, but I found none.

“that was intense” said spirit.
“I know, right” I said.
“indeed” said spirit, “thunder is perfectly OK, And your not as flat as paper”
“I sure hope I’m not as flat paper” I said.
“me too” said spirit.Chapter 17

I went over to thunder, and asked him if his back was good. He did his jumpy thing again, so I guess he meant yes. I took him to the new and improved runway, and we took off. I let go of thunder, and stretched my hands up in the air. That was the first time I had been happy for a long time. I let myself savor the moment, and then I put my hands back on thunder. I heard wings that weren’t thunder’s flapping behind me, and was not surprised to see spirit riding shadow. I asked her what she was doing, and she said she was flying with me. I knew that. I kept flying, and then spirit reached her hand out. I gave her a quick questioning look, but then I understood. I reached my hand out, and she grabbed it. We held hands, and just flew for a while. When we finally landed, I noticed we had been gone for several hours. I went back to my house, and laid down on my bed. Spirit laid down next to me, and grabbed my hand. She said that I was very brave and talented to bring a village like mine up out of a forest death trap, and then win a war with it. I actually never thought about my village that way until then. I actually felt kind of proud of myself for being able to do that. I guess spirit was too. She kissed me on the cheek, and then left. I suddenly felt a lot more relaxed. I looked outside, and saw that the sun was starting to set. ‘I must have been dreaming ’til noon’ I thought. I laid back down in my bed, prepared for another apocalypse dream, but surprisingly, I didn’t have one. That was really lucky.
	the next day, I woke up, and then went strait to the rebuild site. apparently, they had done a lot of work, because at least thirty houses were done
“nice work” I said
“thanks” said one of the fortissimum workers.
	I went around, looking at all of the great work, when suddenly, a giant storm appeared, and I guess I wasn’t paying attention, because everybody else said that it had been rolling in for a while. then, I looked up just as lightning struck beside me.
	I was suddenly in a world that looked as if it were held up by lightning. A big giant rock was floating above me, with lightning holding it up in other places. I looked up, and saw that the rock was glowing. I wondered how I got there, and then figured it must be another dream. So when I saw an arrow(not the creature) heading strait toward my leg, I didn’t move. Better sorry than safe, I guess. The pain was very real. It hit in my right shin, and pierced my skin. The pain radiated through my body, and I screamed. Just as another arrow came wizzing passed my cheek. Bad luck. The next thing that was shot at me was not an arrow. Or an arrow. It was fire. I moved out of the way, but not fast enough. The fire hit my arm, and I rolled around on the ground to stop the burning. The burning did stop, but not before I had a good burn on my arm. I wondered what that place could possibly be, but not for long. That place was the lightning. It was where people go when they got struck by lightning. In which case, I would be going to the real world soon. I thought about how unlucky I was in the past week.
	I was in the lightning for about another hour before I returned to the real world. And when I did, I found the ground under a centimeter water. I guess it flooded while I was gone. I also found that there were some small fires in places. Lightning didn’t usually strike that frequently. I counted ten ground level strikes during the storm. That was extremely unfortunate. I put out some of the fires, with spirit’s help. She said she wanted to keep the kiss secret, and I agreed. We had put out all of the fires by the end of the day, and I went to my bed.Part 4



The fireChapter 18

I woke with a start. I was laying down, head on spirit’s lap, gasping for air. I guess I had a bad dream, because I was covered in sweat, and seemed to remember being blown up. Spirit told me that she had been watching me for an hour, and I was tossing and turning in bed. I sat up, spirit hugged me, and I was happy to have something to hold on to. I laid back down, and noticed that the sun wasn’t up. She laid down beside me, and we fell asleep.
	the next morning, I woke up very tired, and went out to the place where the rebuild was taking place. Once everybody got out of the hospital, the habit breaking would begin. I had actually totally forgot about the habit breaking, until spirit brought it up. Spirit was very helpful. I went to the rebuild place, and found that the people from fortissimum actually built a lot overnight. They had even started making the walls. I decided to go for a walk in the forest, and I asked spirit if she wanted to come with. She said she did, so we armed ourselves, and walked south. For some strange reason, none of the weird people from the forest attacked. We were definitely in their sight, but they didn’t attack. I guess they respected us for protecting some of the creatures that lived in the forest, or maybe they realized we didn’t taste good, or something else. We kept on walking through the forest, until we came to a clearing. I sat down on the ground, and spirit sat beside me. then, I noticed that there were some arrows in a tree, by the edge of the clearing. I called them down, and they came over very cautiously. I held my hand out to the closest arrow, and it nuzzled it. I offered them some fish, which they happily excepted. I picked one up, and laid it on my lap. It purred, and started clawing at the air. I picked up a nearby stick, and laughed as the arrow jumped, and tried to catch the stick in it’s paws. I moved the stick slightly down, and the arrow easily caught it. It ran around with it, and dropped it in front of me. I picked it up, and the arrow jumped up again. I laughed, and then the arrow jumped again, but that time, it was high enough to reach the stick. I laughed as it jumped around with the stick, and then got another stick for the other arrows. I grabbed the other stick, and all the other arrows came running for it. I threw the stick, and then all the arrows chased after it. What I saw next, was extremely surprising. Right after one of the arrows got the stick, another arrow took the stick from it, and then started flying away with it. then, as the other arrow flew away, another arrow shot it out of the sky with a fireball. After the arrow who was shot fell, I ran over to help it, only to find that the other arrows were already fighting over the stick. I tried to get the stick, but all I got was a fistful of fire. Two of the remaining arrows were dead, and the third was on it’s way, so before it got any worse, I carefully took the stick off of the ground, while the other arrows were still preoccupied. then, a pack of neon wolves came, and started attacking the arrows. then, the arrows shot fireballs in every direction, and set the whole forest around them on fire. The neon wolves could not have escaped that. then, I noticed that there was a fairly giant fire very near the village. then, I noticed that the village was made of very flammable materials. then, I noticed that the village could burn down fast if we didn’t do something. ’hell no’ I thought as the flames caught another tree.Chapter 19

I ran back to the village as fast as I could. I looked back frequently, to make sure that spirit was still with me, but I never stopped running. The fire looked pretty weird, because the trees that the arrows directly fired on were on fire with blue flames, well the rest was on fire with orange, red, yellow, and white. When I got back to the village, I told everybody that there was a fire coming, and that we needed to prepare. Everybody sprung into action as soon as they heard about the fire. Conor, Avery, Erin, and James helped me dig a trench in between the forest and arrow, and some other people helped get water into buckets. I filled the trench with water, and then helped the other people fill buckets.
	By the time all of the buckets in the village were full, I looked south, and saw that the fire was getting closer. I was temporarily mesmerized by the flames. That was until a flaming tree fell, and set the one next to it on fire, which fell over, and landed as a sort of bridge across the trench. I said some very bad words as the fire spread to part of the village wall. About half of the population of arrow were carrying buckets, and pouring water on the flaming wall. I signaled thunder to shoot the flaming part of thewall, so that it would blow up all the flames. He did, but it didn’t stop the flames. The wall was on fire, and there was nothing we could do about it. I just watched, as the wall crumbled, and set the nearest village houses on fire. I told everybody to try to put everything out, because that was just about the best strategy at the time, but it didn’t work very well. Especially when the fire reached one of the supply sheds. In the shed was nothing but oil, wood, and air. The supply shed exploded, sending huge chunks of flaming wood everywhere. The fire spread pretty fast after the explosion, but spread even faster when it didn’t blow up oil from someone’s kitchen, but made a river fire coming from their house. The river of fire set three other houses on fire, before getting completely burnt out. The burnt out fire river was a good thing. not because before it burnt out, it set a bunch of houses on fire, but because it could no longer set a bunch of houses on fire. I dumped many buckets of water on a house, before deciding that there was just about no way to save the village from the fire.
	after that decision, I also decided to order an evacuation of the village. Everybody besides officials who could help were ordered to evacuate. After everybody was safely across the river, I started one of the methods we had used in smaller fires. Blowing up everything flammable in the near vicinity of the fire. While I was doing that with thunder, spirit was making defenses for my house. apparently, she really liked it, because she built a stone(real stone) wall around it. then, I got an idea. We could build walls. That would actually just mean more people’s attention away from the fire. That would not be good. I then decided to experiment with something. I told thunder to get some arrows to dive into the river, and scoop up water with their mouths. They did, and when they got to some of the flames, they sprayed out all of the water. It actually made a small difference. But only a small difference. After about a half hour of mouth water, most of the village was on fire, but my house was still safe. We ended up blowing up everything that was on fire. well, not everything. More like one sixteenth. anyway, after more blowing up, I ended up ordering a full evacuation. Everybody was required to leave the village.Chapter 20

I crossed the river, and sat down on the beach, and watched, as the village burned down. I sighed, and laid down, hoping that the fire would decide to burn out soon. That was a pretty far fetched hope, though, because the fire just kept burning. Another oil river was unleashed , and it set everything besides my house on fire. There was so much fire. I made a decision. I would get together all of the spearheads, and make them do a mushroom cloud on the village, and the part of the forest that was on fire. After that, everybody would go in with water, to put out any small fires that were left over. I got. Together all of the spearheads, and told them the plan. They all jumped around in circles, and I mounted thunder. I went over the river, and we flew up in the air. Once we were in the air, I flew thunder down towards the wall, which he blew up in one hit. After the wall, we just went. For whatever was burning. I guess one of the spearheads took the put out every fire a little bit to seriously, because it kept blowing up the same spot over and over again, because there was a little fire left over from the explosion. I told him that small fires like that were OK, and he stopped blowing up his hole. That was when the storm came. The storm that set the village on fire again. The storm that struck one of the un-blown up houses with lightning. The fire started up again, and whenever we put out a fire, another one started elsewhere. The fires were everywhere by the time the storm passed. I told everybody to pitch in to help, because I couldn’t do it on my own. I divided people up into squads, and told the different squads what their job was. The first squad I assigned’s job was to protect houses that weren’t burning, the next squad’s job was to pour water on just put out fires, to cool them off. Squad number three was the shoot bolistas at fires to make them collapse, and be easier to be put out, and number four was the arrows and spearheads in the air, blowing up things that needed blowing up, and dumping water on the ones that didn’t. After all of the squads were assigned, I went back in the air, and started putting out fires.
	it took a long time, but soon enough, all of the fires were put out, except for the forest, which would take more work. I decided to go to my house, and rest before we planned about how to put out the forest.Chapter 21

I was sleeping in my bed, at least, I think I was sleeping, because my dream about being struck by lightning seemed pretty real, but anyway, I woke up, and spirit was right next to me, and apparently, she had been trying to shake me awake for quite a while, because she said that the forest fire had gotten a lot worse over night. I invited Conor, Avery, Erin, and James over to my house, and we planned about how to put out the forest fire. Avery thought that we should just blow up the whole burning. forest, but I said that it wasn’t a good idea, because if we did. that, we would kill some of creatures that weren’t yet killed by the fire. Avery agreed that her idea was a bad one, and didn’t suggest anything for the rest of the meeting. James suggested that we do the thing where all of the arrows use their mouths to get a bunch of water, but that wouldn’t work, because the water would just evaporate from the heat of the fire. Erin suggested that we just set a controlled fire around the big one, since fire isn’t flammable. That seemed like a pretty good idea, so we decided to try it. I flew around the big forest fire, blowing up all of the trees around it. Avery and Erin were on the edge, making sure the controlled fire didn’t get out of control. I flew around the big fire, looking around for anything inside, when I saw something astonishing. There was a human being inside. And that human being was my mother’s sister’s daughter. I quickly got my non camouflage armor on, and instructed thunder to fly me into my mother’s sister’s daughter’s area. he did, and once we were close enough, I jumped off of thunder’s back, and landed about ten feet away from her. I yelled at her, calling her ‘mother’s sister’s daughter’, and she said her name was wolf. I told her to come over to me, but she just pointed at the ground between us. That was when I noticed that we were completely surrounded by blue fire. And there was a narrow strip between us. That was a problem. Just then, I noticed I hadn’t told anybody about wolf. My cousin would die if I didn’t save her, and I didn’t even think to tell anybody besides thunder about her. I decided that I had to protect her, even if it meant putting myself in danger. I decided to try to jump over the strip of fire that was separating us, and then keep going from there. I backed up, ran, and actually made the jump. then, I noticed that the things that were set on fire because of the blue fire, were still blue. Not orange, red, yellow, and white. Actually, there was white mixed in with the blue, but that’s besides the point. I pulled wolf closer to me, and wrapped my arms around her, to shield her from the flames. The fire started closing in around us, and I wrapped my arms more tightly around wolf. She started whimpering, and it didn’t take long for me to realize that it wasn’t just from fear. I noticed that there were flames licking up both of our legs, but only wolf could feel it, because she didn’t have armor. I started patting at the flames on her legs, but it was no use. She was burning, and I couldn’t do anything about it. I pulled her closer to me, and she started crying. I thought for a split second about telling her that everything was going to be OK, but I didn’t want my last words to my cousin to be lies. I decided not to say anything, but then I got an idea. I yelled to thunder, even though there was only a small chance he could here me, and surprise surprise, he didn’t hear. then, I called again, and even though I was trying to scream, something else came out. I let out a roar about the volume of thunder and cloudy’s mushroom cloud. I surprised even myself with the roar. Thunder came flying toward us, and landed in a relatively safe spot. Once we were on, instead of flying us to arrow, thunder flew us to the river, and brought us underwater. After that, he brought us to the hospital, where they took wolf away, and treated her burns. The I heard something I was very surprised to hear. I heard the sound of the mushroom cloud that thunder and cloudy made, and was very surprised when I looked at the forest. The whole entire flaming part of the forest was on fire with sky high blue flames. I didn’t think it was ever going to go out. But then, something else very surprising happened. The forest exploded, and then started smoking with blue smoke that in two minutes had covered the entire sky within five miles around the village. That day was very crazy. then, I suddenly had a thought about the explosion. What happened to Avery and Erin. I ran as fast as humanly possible to thunder, and told him to fly me over to where the big explosion had happened. The ruins were incredibly awful. where the explosion had gone of, was a big pile of rubble, shooting blue smoke into the sky at two thousand miles per hour. I noticed that all of the land within miles was just a bunch of grey rubble. I looked around for Avery and Erin, but they were nowhere to be seen. Until they were. After two minutes of flying around, I finally saw them. I looked down, and saw Avery waving her hands in the air, and Erin lying on the ground, very bloody. I flew down to them, and asked Avery what happened. She said that when the explosion went off, Erin was right next to it, and got thrown back twenty feet, and hit a piece of rubble. I told Avery that I would get Erin back to arrow as soon as I could, and then I would come back for her. Avery and I lifted Erin carefully onto thunder’s back, then I got on thunder’s back as well, and we lifted off toward arrow. then, something ungood happened. well, more like something bad. Erin fell off of thunder’s back, and screamed as she plummeted toward the ground. I flew after her with thunder, but I knew we couldn’t catch her. She hit the ground hard, and I screamed. I collected her body, and flew it back to arrow, totally forgetting that Avery existed. I laid her bloody body down in her parents place in the forest that was across the river, and then remembered that Avery was still by the dead forest. I flew back, and told her that Erin was dead. She didn’t say a word, and got on thunder’s back.Chapter 22

I was in my house, laying down on my bed, crying about Erin, when spirit came in and comforted me. She grabbed my hand with one of her hands, and rubbed my back with the other. I was grateful for the support, and I think spirit knew that, because she didn’t stop.
	the next day, I went over to the dead forest, which is what I had decided to call the big dead part of the forest, and looked around for anything useful. I was surprised when my mother, who had come with me, suggested that I gather a bottle full of the blue smoke. I got out a bottle, and swiped it through the billow of smoke. When I had safely gathered it, I was surprised when I found that inside, instead of smoke, there was blue dust. I wondered what it could be used for, and tried unstoppering the bottle. nothing. I put the stopper back on, and put the bottle in my pocket.
	suddenly, I heard a scream behind me, so I turned around, and I was surprised to see my mother falling into the smoking pile of rubble. But when she hit the ground, I did not expect what I saw. My mother was suddenly on fire with blue fire, and she was screaming in agony. I screamed to my mother, but nothing happened. then, she started to disintegrate, and then she started crumbling. And then, she was nothing. I screamed for my mother, but nothing came back. I angrily took out the bottle of ash, and threw it at a tree. The tree exploded in a big blue fireball, and all of the trees around it were on fire. I signaled for thunder to get some water to put it out, and he did. then, I thought, ‘a use!’ My mother’s death would not be in vain.
Chapter 23

I ran back to the village, and told everybody that there was a use for the ash. They all followed me, and I told them that I needed a bottle. One of the citizens gave me one, and and I filled it with ash. then, I threw it at one of the trees, and the tree exploded. The citizens understood, and I said that nobody was to go anywhere near the dead forest.
	I went back to my house, and when I got there, I told thunder to move the stone wall that was surrounding it. After that, I went inside with thunder, and it was a good thing we did, because not long after, it started raining. But it wasn’t raining water, it was raining ash. Any ash exposed to one of the outside torches would explode, and any ash that came into contact with metal would disintegrate. ‘it’s raining ash!” I thought, as some more of the outdoor torches exploded. I hunkered inside, and watched everything get destroyed by the ash. The storm was a big problem,considering that if one explosion happened in the wrong place, it could set off a huge chain reaction that would destroy the whole entire village. I decided that once that ash storm ended, I would make an announcement that during ash storms, everybody was required to stay inside until further notice.
	after a few hours, the storm had run it’s course, and I had made my announcement. After the announcement, I decided to. Collect a bunch of ash bottles, just in case we would ever be needing them. then, after I had collected about three hundred ash bottles, I went back to my house, and laid down on my bed.
	the next day, king ghost came, and announced that from then on, fortissimum would help arrow in the case of an ash storm by giving supplies to help with burns, making house shields, and and collecting ash. I told ghost that he couldn’t collect ash, and he seemed pretty pissed off by that, but I had to keep all the ash in arrow, where it belonged.
